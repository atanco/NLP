The script should be downloaded and placed in the same folder where the extractad movie review data is. (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/pabo/movie-review-data/)
The script can be ran from a Terminal with this syntax: Rscript deliverable.R arg1 arg2 arg3, where arg1 is the starting word, arg2 is the minimum requested length of the chain and arg3 is the maximum number of attempts to find that chain
For example: Rscript deliverable.R kendal 15 10
The script requires the silly package for hyphenation
